 * THE ROUTER THE OPENAPI CONTRACT ROWS PROJECT, and the projection itself
 * called over it.
 *
 * WHY A MODULE AND NOT A ROW ARGUMENT: an oRPC procedure's contract IS its
 * valibot schemas, so this router has no JSON spelling and a function_call
 * row cannot carry it in `args`. The CASES are registry rows (suite_type
 * function_call, package @teamscala/orpc) rendered by
 * ts_function_contract_runner; this file is the fixture those rows call, and
 * nothing else. The subject is this file's second export rather than
 * `openapi.ts`'s own because a row names a module and an export, and the
 * production function is reached through the wrapper in one call.
 *
 * THE FIXTURE SHAPE IS THE ONE THAT MUST BE RIGHT: a valibot record input and
 * NO `.route()` metadata, exactly as the generated CRUD routers declare
 * themselves, because structure-derived path derivation is what a router
 * carrying no paths of its own exercises.
