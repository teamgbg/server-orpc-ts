/**
 * @system orpc
 * @status handwritten
 * @edit edit directly
 *
 * THE OpenAPI contract for a service's composed oRPC router — generated from
 * the SAME router object the RPC handler serves, so the document cannot
 * describe procedures the server does not have and cannot omit ones it does
 * (`information-exists-in-one-location`: the router is the one home of the
 * contract; this module is its projection, never a second declaration). The
 * caller passes the router it already holds — the mount site fetched it to
 * mount the handler, and a second lookup would only be a second chance to
 * disagree.
 *
 * The generator is the supplier's (`@orpc/openapi` OpenAPIGenerator) with the
 * supplier's valibot converter (`@orpc/valibot`) — our procedures validate
 * with valibot, so the JSON Schema in the document derives from the very
 * schemas the handler enforces at call time. OpenAPI 3.1.1 out.
 *
 * Procedures carry no `.route()` metadata (the generated CRUD router never
 * sets one), so the generator derives each path from the router structure
 * (`/registry_entries/findMany`) and defaults the method to POST — the exact
 * shape `RPCHandler` serves under the mount prefix. `servers` therefore names
 * the prefix the caller reaches us at; the mount site derives it from the
 * request so internal (`scala-portal.internal:5200`) and public hosts both
 * produce a callable document.
